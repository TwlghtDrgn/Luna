# Luna
Discord bot, re-written on Java, and previously written on JavaScript (see [luna-nodejs](https://github.com/TwlghtDrgn/Luna/tree/luna-nodejs))
___
Luna is a bot, named after an alicorn princess from the 'My Little Pony'

Luna has some commands, such as:
- /dice - Throws a dice
- /emoji - In theory, sends known to Luna emoji
- /radio - Plays a radio station of mine in the Staged channels. Also displays now playing Artist-Title in the header of the server
- /slap - A funny way to ping someone. Inspired by [Cadyr](https://udj.at/cadyr), a bot, written by one of [PuffersWorld](https://puffers.world) Discord server owners

Also, chat module now works again!
